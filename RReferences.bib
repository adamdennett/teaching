	abstract = {In 1850, beer was scarce in Mexico; most Mexicans instead drank traditional fermented beverages made from a variety of plants, such as maize and maguey. But by 1930, beer had become one of the country’s largest modern industries, and by mid-century it was the alcoholic beverage of choice for most Mexicans. Today, Mexico is the world’s largest exporter of beer. The geography of beer in Mexico thus has a relatively recent history. Its origins lie in the 1890s, when a number of dominant breweries emerged to command regional markets from their bases in rapidly growing provincial cities. Through the twentieth century, as urbanization accelerated and Mexicans increasingly turned to beer, three of these fought for a national presence. By the 1980s, buy-outs and mergers yielded a duopoly poised to pursue exports aggressively. The historical geography of Mexican beer can thus be mapped globally as well as over a century of shifting regional and national production.},

	abstract = {During the 1490s, over 1,500 microbreweries sprouted and flourished across the country. This expansion of microbreweries derives, in part, from the desire of people to break away from the smothering homogeneity of popular, national culture. Such breweries are often proudly and sellconsciously local, sporting local historical photos, maps, and other artifacts of a place's personality as part of the decor. Geographer Wes Flack has hypothesized that the growth of such establishments is a prime illustration of a movement termed “neolocalism,” in which people are attempting to reconnect with the local, the personal, and the unique. The microbrewery industry has undergone rapid expansion and major upheaval in the decade since F7lack first carried out his research. This study examines recent trends in the industry and determines that his original thesis is as valid as it was when he first offered it. The core of this paper is an analysis of how ale names and visual marketing imagery are used by microbreweries to tap into this powerful feeling, and of the ways that these images serve to create local loyalties and identities. We argue that such imagery offers us a valuable window into the process of neolocalism—the active, conscious creation and maintenance of attachment to place.},

Economic expansion, war, immigration, temperance/prohibition, politics, religion, transportation, and economic depression all shaped the beer brewing landscape from colonial times to the present. This chapter draws upon a brewery database from the American Breweriana Association to geolocate breweries across the United States over time. I provide a time-series set of maps to illustrate the interplay and imprint of the aforementioned themes. Comprehensive time-series maps of this nature have rarely, if ever, been assembled. By compiling maps in this way it is possible to observe geographic patterns and explore historical connections and spatial relationships from regional and national perspectives. In some cases, we find what we expect from known historical events; but we also find inconsistencies, distinctive patterns not accounted for in the history literature. In this way we may come to understand better the regional patterns we see today. Brewery locations today are not only a legacy of the past but also a reflection of contemporary society and culture.},

The causes of internal migration in Great Britain constitute a topic still largely unexplored. This study attempts to draw together various possible causal variables which are of interest both to the demographer and the economist. Using the most reliable source of migration statistics, the Census of Population, an examination is undertaken into the effect of regional population sizes and distances in respect to one another, the simple gravity model, as well as the effects of the regional changes in employment in manufacturing industry in the 1950s on the gross flows of migrants for the Census year, 1961. The latter variable, coupled with the regional allocation of service industries, would appear to be an important addition to the economist in his attempt to pinpoint the most important economic influences on the migration movement in order to find measures which will regulate such movement.},

We present data on bilateral flows between 196 countries from 1990 through 2010 that provide a comprehensive view of international migration flows. Our data suggest a stable intensity of global 5-year migration flows at {\textasciitilde}0.6\% of world population since 1995. In addition, the results aid the interpretation of trends and patterns of migration flows to and from individual countries by placing them in a regional or global context. We estimate the largest movements to occur between South and West Asia, from Latin to North America, and within Africa.},

However, this is not necessarily the case for local housing markets, whose spatial structures may exhibit persistence, so that conditions may not be those most suited to the requirements of modern-day living. Persistence can arise from the existence of transaction costs. The paper tests the proposition that housing markets in Inner London exhibit a degree of path dependence, through the construction of a three-equation model, and examines the impact of variables constructed for the 19th and early 20th centuries on modern house prices. These include 19th-century social structures, slum clearance programmes and the 1908 underground network. Each is found to be significant. The tests require the construction of novel historical datasets, which are also described in the paper.},

A group of persons recorded in a census as natives of county A and residents of county B are sometimes referred to as lifetime migrants from county A to country B. Statistics of lifetime migrants have often been used in studies of internal migration but these have one great disadvantage. The number of lifetime migrants from A to B does not relate to a specific period of time. It is impossible, for example, in such studies to consider the association between specific migration streams and differential economic activity. An attempt is made in this study to transform lifetime migration data into intercensal migration streams. Some of the results are presented and the most significant migration patterns during the period 1851-1951 are described.},

We employ data on mobile-phone use to compare variations in segregation indices during the day, the week, and the year. The results indicate that the locations of people are more segregated at night, with considerably less segregation during the daytime. The segregation is significantly lower on workdays compared to weekends. Segregation is also lower during summer holidays compared to the winter working period. The results show that although places of residence are segregated, different ethnic groups use the city together during the day, which increases the potential for interethnic contacts. The results demonstrate also that temporal segregation indices based on mobile-phone use are considerably lower than segregation indices of places of residence that are derived from the census.},

	abstract = {Review of some partial models of intra-urban migration suggests that, in each case, a separate causal mechanism produces virtually the same result. An amalgamation of these models suggests that the majority of in-migrants to a city should first reside in the inner residential areas where their arrival will initiate a process of invasion and succession. Within the suburbs, the greater competition for housing in inner areas should encourage most movers to proceed to destinations closer to the urban periphery, so that the general migratory trend within the city should be away from the centre. These propositions are tested with the data given in the Migration Tables of the 1961 Census for Greater London. This evidence clearly suggests that a process of invasion and succession is occurring within the central part of the area, especially in the west, but farther out, the general expected tendency is not so clear; this is partly, it seems, because of deficiencies in the data. Information on the housing characteristics of migrants further supports the invasion and succession model in the inner areas but, although many of the patterns are as hypothesized, it is not possible definitively to isolate the relevant processes.},

This study represents a first step towards building a methodology whereby mobile phone data can be more usefully applied to transportation research. In this paper, we present techniques to extract useful mobility information from the mobile phone traces of millions of users to investigate individual mobility patterns within a metropolitan area. The mobile-phone-based mobility measures are compared to mobility measures computed using odometer readings from the annual safety inspections of all private vehicles in the region to check the validity of mobile phone data in characterizing individual mobility and to identify the differences between individual mobility and vehicular mobility. The empirical results can help us understand the intra-urban variation of mobility and the non-vehicular component of overall mobility. More importantly, this study suggests that mobile phone trace data represent a reasonable proxy for individual mobility and show enormous potential as an alternative and more frequently updatable data source and a compliment to the conventional travel surveys in mobility study.},

	abstract = {Access to and use of mobile telephony in sub-Saharan Africa has increased dramatically over the past decade. Mobile telephony has brought new possibilities to the continent. Across urban-rural and rich-poor divides, mobile phones connect individuals to individuals, information, markets, and services. These effects can be particularly dramatic in rural Africa, where in many places mobile phones have represented the first modern telecommunications infrastructure of any kind. Mobile phones have greatly reduced communication costs, thereby allowing individuals and firms to send and to obtain information quickly and cheaply on a variety of economic, social, and political topics. An emerging body of research shows that the reduction in communication costs associated with mobile phones has tangible economic benefits, improving agricultural and labor market efficiency and producer and consumer welfare in specific circumstances and countries. This paper first examines the evolution of mobile phone coverage and adoption in sub-Saharan Africa over the past decade. We then explore the main channels through which mobile phones can effect economic outcomes and appraise current evidence of its potential to improve economic development. We conclude with directions for future research and outline the necessary conditions for mobile phones to promote broader economic development in Africa.},

The age and migration structures are identified over time by using the logit model for categorical data. Just as model schedules can be used to capture the age patterns of fertility, mortality, and migration rates for use in indirect estimation, so too the models set out in this paper can be used to capture the spatidal patterns exhibited by particular sets of age-specific and origin-destination-specific migration proportions. They then also can be used to impose these patterns on inaccurate, incomplete, or otherwise inadequate data.},

Development of global beer culture and modern beer styles are rooted in specific, historical brewing centers around the world. According to the Periodic Table of Beer Styles II, there are 65 existing beer styles. This continues to change as brewers are constantly creating new hybrids styles and in 2013, The BJCP (Beer Judge Certification Program) recognized 80 individual styles. In the world of beer, there are very few appellations that restrict the use of style names to a geographic areas—such as the styles of Lambic (a spontaneously fermented beer that originates from an area just southwest of Brussels) and Kölsch (a blonde, lightly hopped ale brewed only by the brewers of Cologne [Köln]). Other styles such as Trappist, while originating in medieval Normandy, France are now primarily located in the Western European countries where beer took its monastic traditions. This chapter introduces historical and geographical importance of styles such as Pilsners, Porters, Stouts, Pale Ales, India Pale Ales, Cream Ales, and Steam Beers.},

	abstract = {ConclusionWe have argued that time geography provides a perspective that helps unify the two paradigms of (a) multi-agent systems, as developed within computer science, and (b) microsimulations, as developed within the social sciences. By identifying and defining these two paradigms, and by reasoning about the central concepts of each of them, we have taken a first step in amalgamating them. We have attempted to take a general systems approach in order to avoid myopia and jargon limitations, and hopefully avoid being too narrow in scope (an approach different from, e. g., Gimblett, 2002).Our claim is that developments based on a synthesis of the three paradigms offer a rich potential for substantial advance of systems analysis methodology. It gives a new angle to classical problems like how to achieve consistency with the world outside a defined core system boundary, how to simultaneously represent processes on very different spatial and temporal scales, how to enable agents to concurrently obey internal and external rules, and how to integrate observable and postulated behavior while preserving achievability of endogenous emergence.},

It then establishes a continuum of neoliberalism ranging from a project for radical system transformation from state socialism to market capitalism, through a basic regime shift within capitalism, to more limited policy adjustments intended to maintain another type of accumulation regime and its mode of regulation. These last two forms of neoliberalism are then related to a broader typology of approaches to the restructuring, rescaling, and reordering of accumulation and regulation in advanced capitalist societies: neoliberalism, neocorporatism, neostatism, and neocommunitarianism. These arguments are illustrated in the final part of the paper through a critique of the World Report on the Urban Future 21 (World Commission 2000), both as an explicit attempt to promote flanking and supporting measures to sustain the neoliberal project on the urban scale and as an implicit attempt to naturalize that project on a global scale.},

To date, direct evidence on the scale or impact of these flows has been weak since they are difficult to assess using survey methods. Using 2001 census data for England and Scotland, this paper looks at the scale and composition of flows for deprived neighbourhoods with a particular focus on educational attainment. It analyses the impacts of these flows on the characteristics of deprived areas, exploring differences between regions and comparing neighbourhoods involved in two major regeneration programmes with other deprived areas. The paper shows that selective migration flows do serve to reinforce spatial segregation but that the scale of this effect appears very modest and that impacts vary between regions. Flows for the regeneration areas are less adverse than for similarly deprived neighbourhoods.},

Smart urbanism discourses are deeply rooted in seductive and normative visions of the future where digital technology stands as the primary driver for change. Yet our understanding of the opportunities, challenges, and implications of smart urbanism is limited. Research in this field is in its infancy, fragmented along disciplinary lines and often based on single city case studies. As a result, we lack both the theoretical insight and empirical evidence required to assess the implications of this potentially transformative phenomenon. Given the significant implications of smart urbanism there is an urgent need to critically engage with why, how, for whom and with what consequences smart urbanism is emerging in different urban contexts. The aim of this review is to unpack the different logics and rationales behind smart urbanism discourses and proposals, and in this way understand the ways by which imaginaries of urban futures are currently being constructed, along with their socio-technical and political implications for future research priorities.},

The findings from the fieldwork show that the UK microbrewing sector is growing, that competitiveness within the brewing establishment is based on artisan manufacture, provenance and diversity rather than price, and that the sector is contestable but operates as a competitive fringe within the greater industry. The study illustrates that microbreweries can contribute to local economies and that, because of the innovation, diversity and growth in the sector, entrepreneurship is in evidence. While saturation seems a threat, the evidence presented here suggests that UK microbrewing is a healthy sector, with the prospect of ongoing growth and contribution.},

Drawing on actor-network theory and critical planning theory, the paper analyzes IBM's smarter city campaign and finds it to be storytelling, aimed at making the company an ‘obligatory passage point’ in the implementation of urban technologies. Our argument unfolds in three parts. We first trace the emergence of the term ‘smart city’ in the public sphere. Secondly, we show that IBM's influential story about smart cities is far from novel but rather mobilizes and revisits two long-standing tropes: systems thinking and utopianism. Finally, we conclude, first by addressing two critical questions raised by this discourse: technocratic reductionism and the introduction of new moral imperatives in urban management; and second, by calling for the crafting of alternative smart city stories.},

	abstract = {A substantial literature has developed regarding the relationship between migration and housing tenure in Britain. It has been argued that, although those moving into council (public sector) housing are more likely to move than those moving into owner-occupied housing, administrative controls restrict potential population movement into council housing over long distances. Others have criticised this argument suggesting that council residents are typically individuals who are less likely to migrate over long distances regardless of the administrative restrictions imposed upon them. Accordingly, it is important to control for individual characteristics before the independent effect of tenure on mobility can be determined. This paper is a report of an investigation of this relationship in the South East of England, in which the Sample of Anonymised Records, a unique individual-level British data source for this type of study, were used. The study continues with a consideration of the influence of housing on migration into the South East from the North of Britain for those in manual and nonmanual occupations.},

Previous research highlights the relevance of simulation techniques in estimating the potential outcomes of changes in areas such as taxation and child benefit policy, crime, education, or health inequalities. To date, however, there is very little published research on the creation, calibration, and testing of such micropopulations and models, and little on the issue of how well synthetic data can fit locally as opposed to globally in such models. This paper discusses the process of improving the process of synthetic micropopulation generation with the aim of improving and extending existing spatial microsimulation models. Experiments using different variable configurations to constrain the models are undertaken with the emphasis on producing a suite of models to match the different sociodemographic conditions found within a typical city. The results show that creating processes to generate area-specific synthetic populations, which reflect the diverse populations within the study area, provides more accurate population estimates for future policy work than the traditional global model configurations.},

The second section focuses on theanalysis of (known) spatial interaction flows. The effects associated with the region of origin, region of destination and spatial separation are identified and quantified. A ‘distance effect’ is derived from the flow matrix. A measure of accessibility is developed and compared with accessibility measures derived from different forms of distance functions. The third section deals with theestimation of spatial interaction flows. It is shown how the quality of the estimates (and hence the model performance) can be improved by efficiently adding information. This is particularly relevant in the estimation of disaggregated spatial interaction flows.},

A review of the history of this type of urban social analysis highlights some persistent challenges. In this paper existing geodemographic approaches are extended through coupling the Kohonen Self-Organizing Map algorithm (SOM), a data-mining technique, with geographic information systems (GIS). This approach allows the construction of linked maps of social (attribute) and geographic space. This novel type of geodemographic classification allows ad hoc hierarchical groupings and exploration of the relationship between social similarity and geographic proximity. It allows one to filter complex demographic datasets and is capable of highlighting general social patterns while retaining the fundamental social fingerprints of a city. A dataset describing 79 attributes of the 2217 census tracts in New York City is analyzed to illustrate the technique. Pairs of social and geographic maps are formally compared using simple pattern metrics. Our analysis of New York City calls into question some assumptions about the functional form of spatial relationships that underlie many modeling and statistical techniques.},

	abstract = {Leveraging Big Data and 21st century technology to renew cities and citizenship in America The Responsive City is a guide to civic engagement and governance in the digital age that will help leaders link important breakthroughs in technology and data analytics with age-old lessons of small-group community input to create more agile, competitive, and economically resilient cities. Featuring vivid case studies highlighting the work of pioneers in New York, Boston, Chicago and more, the book provides a compelling model for the future of governance. The book will help mayors, chief technology officers, city administrators, agency directors, civic groups and nonprofit leaders break out of current paradigms to collectively address civic problems. The Responsive City is the culmination of research originating from the Data-Smart City Solutions initiative, an ongoing project at Harvard Kennedy School working to catalyze adoption of data projects on the city level. The book is co-authored by Professor Stephen Goldsmith, director of Data-Smart City Solutions at Harvard Kennedy School, and Professor Susan Crawford, co-director of Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and Society. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg penned the book’s foreword. Based on the authors’ experiences and extensive research, The Responsive City explores topics including:  Building trust in the public sector and fostering a sustained, collective voice among communities; Using data-smart governance to preempt and predict problems while improving quality of life; Creating efficiencies and saving taxpayer money with digital tools; and Spearheading these new approaches to government with innovative leadership.},

It is also about a desire on the part of many Americans to re-connect with place.. Such breweries are often proudly and self-consciously local, and often use imagery and stories associated with a particular place as a means of promoting their brews. This active, conscious creation and maintenance of attachment to place is termed neolocalism. This chapter provides an overview of the geography of microbrewing and its historical development in the United States. It then analyzes how ale names and visual marketing imagery used by microbreweries tap into this powerful concept of neolocalism, and how these images serve to create local loyalties and identities. We argue that such imagery offers a valuable window into the neolocalism movement and the process of place attachment.},

	abstract = {The problem of comparing two different partitions of a finite set of objects reappears continually in the clustering literature. We begin by reviewing a well-known measure of partition correspondence often attributed to Rand (1971), discuss the issue of correcting this index for chance, and note that a recent normalization strategy developed by Morey and Agresti (1984) and adopted by others (e.g., Miligan and Cooper 1985) is based on an incorrect assumption. Then, the general problem of comparing partitions is approached indirectly by assessing the congruence of two proximity matrices using a simple cross-product measure. They are generated from corresponding partitions using various scoring rules. Special cases derivable include traditionally familiar statistics and/or ones tailored to weight certain object pairs differentially. Finally, we propose a measure based on the comparison of object triples having the advantage of a probabilistic interpretation in addition to being corrected for chance (i.e., assuming a constant value under a reasonable null hypothesis) and bounded between ±1.},

	url = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/2172611},
	abstract = {The main trend in urban/rural migration is a continuous gain, in net terms, of towns from villages and large cities. But this is a result of two distinct migration streams associated with the process of family formation. While before marriage there is positive net migration from villages to both large cities and towns (and from large cities towards towns), after marriage there is a tendency for couples to move towards villages. This is explained by the desire of families, particularly those belonging to the middle class to move out of the urban centres to better accommodation in smaller communities. Considerable variations in migrations within and into regions are observed. These reflect the continuation of long-term trends in internal migration (as described in Part I of this paper) in particular, population dispersal from Greater London and larger distance migration into the Southern and Eastern regions. Some social characteristics of migrants and non-migrants are compared. Associations between the intensity of internal migration on the one hand, and occupational status, education, social mobility and family size on the other are observed. An attempt is made to assess the extent of migration associated with the marriage process. Although this process increases mobility, its relative contribution to total adult mobility appears to be only slight.},

We examine how France's urban planning, guided by political and economic influences, has created and sustained banlieue poverty and marginalization. With rising anxieties about civil disorder in Paris resulting from the spatial inequities and cultural stigma toward the banlieue, it is now generally agreed that the city's historical planning policies have failed. We argue that any attempt to allocate space within a city equitably cannot emanate from the city center alone, but must also come from the marginalized periphery, which is equally a part of the system.},

At the turn of the millennium, just a handful of breweries was operating in London, but by 2016 this number had risen to over 85. Using open data from the Companies House database augmented with other online and printed sources, we show that the rapid growth of breweries, particularly since 2011, has exhibited spatial patterning. Ripley's K analysis reveals that as soon as we see new breweries emerging, they are clustering in space. Cluster analyses reveal that Bermondsey and Hackney are particular locational hotspots for brewing. Closer investigation of the Bermondsey cluster highlights the importance of a number of interacting physical, social and economic factors in helping foster this growth. We show that the railways and the spaces they have created, the general atmosphere of cooperation and sharing surrounding the industry in the city, macro-economic and fiscal changes, foreign influence, technology and markets have all played their part in the recent spatial and temporal evolution of brewing in the city.},

These include deterministic reweighting, conditional probability (Monte Carlo simulation) and simulated annealing. However, each of these approaches is limited by, for example, the level of geography to which it can be applied, or number of characteristics of the real population that can be replicated. The research examines and critiques the performance of each of these methods over varying spatial scales. Results show that the most consistent and accurate populations generated over all the spatial scales are produced from the simulated annealing algorithm. The relative merits and limitations of each method are evaluated in the discussion.},

We present in this paper some explicit formulas of edge effect correction that should enable plant ecologists to analyse a wider range of real field data. We consider the local correcting factor of edge effect for Ripley's K-function, that can also be used for other statistics of spatial analysis based on the counting of neighbours within a given distance. For both circular and rectangular study areas, we provide a review of explicit formulas and an extension of these formulas for long and narrow plots. In the case of irregular-shaped study plots, we propose a generalization of the method that computes edge effect correction by excluding triangular surfaces from a simple (rectangular or circular) initial shape. An example in forest ecology, where the soil characteristics determine a study plot of complex shape, illustrates how this edge effect correction can be effective in avoiding misinterpretations.},

	abstract = {This paper explores IBM's Smarter Cities Challenge as an example of global smart city policymaking. The evolution of IBM's smart city thinking is discussed, then a case study of Philadelphia's online workforce education initiative, Digital On-Ramps, is presented as an example of IBM's consulting services. Philadelphia's rationale for working with IBM and the translation of IBM's ideas into locally adapted initiatives is considered. The paper argues that critical scholarship on the smart city over-emphasizes IBM's agency in driving the discourse. Unpacking how and why cities enrolled in smart city policymaking with IBM places city governments as key actors advancing the smart city paradigm. Two points are made about the policy mobility of the smart city as a mask for entrepreneurial governance. (1) Smart city efforts are best understood as examples of outward-looking policy promotion for the globalized economy. (2) These policies proposed citywide benefit through a variety of digital governance augmentations, unlike established urban, economic development projects such as a downtown redevelopment. Yet, the policy rhetoric of positive change was always oriented to fostering globalized business enterprise. As such, implementing the particulars of often-untested smart city policies mattered less than their capacity to attract multinational corporations.},

	abstract = {The global beer industry has transformed dramatically in recent decades. Two key trends include (1) consolidation resulting from mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures, and (2) the largest firms expanding into new regions. While beer was previously a very local product, these trends have combined to result in approximately half of global sales being controlled by just four firms: AB InBev, SABMiller, Heineken, and Carlsberg. Notably, these top four companies are all headquartered in Western Europe. The primary products of the largest firms are pale lagers, with ales and numerous other potential beer varieties produced only in much smaller quantities, if at all. Why are these changes occurring now? Many other industries, including soft drinks, have seen a small number of companies achieve global dominance earlier than the beer industry. Recent policy and technological changes, however, have eroded many barriers to consolidation and geographic expansion for beer firms. They have enabled the largest firms to exert more political and economic power, and to move closer to the endgame of a global monopoly. These trends are not inevitable, however, and are countered by (1) the rise of specialty brewers and their much more diverse selection of beer varieties, and (2) cultural barriers to the global branding and marketing of beer.},

This large increase was mainly in the form of craft breweries. We argue that the expansion of craft breweries fits well within the theory of division of resources, in which companies that serve small market niches represent a challenge for monopolistic competition of the multinationals that dominate the beer industry. We further suggest that greater allocation of resources is present in places more attractive and creative urban attributes, which helps explain why there are large disparities in regional craft breweries, with the South represented the worst. The main focus of the analysis is in metropolitan areas throughout the South, and the country as a whole.

Neither the regional or national models regression produced a high degree of explanatory power to indicate that the spatial distribution of the craft beer industry is affected by legal, moral and religious issues.

Besides geographic space, in this paper, we characterize mobility in a profile-based space (activity-aware map) that describes most probable activity associated with a specific area of space. This, in turn, allows us to capture the individual daily activity pattern and analyze the correlations among different people’s work area’s profile. Based on a large mobile phone data of nearly one million records of the users in the central Metro-Boston area, we find a strong correlation in daily activity patterns within the group of people who share a common work area’s profile. In addition, within the group itself, the similarity in activity patterns decreases as their work places become apart.},

Physical, cultural, and economic geographies have played crucial roles in this story. The history reflects how plants, people, and ideas engaged in global exchanges over centuries as a means to achieve agricultural and brewing success. In the twenty-first century, commercial hop growing occurs in many temperate regions of the world. But that was not always the case, and understanding how this specialty crop developed helps us better understand the contents of our beer glasses.},

	abstract = {Debates about the future of urban development in many Western countries have been increasingly influenced by discussions of smart cities. Yet despite numerous examples of this ‘urban labelling’ phenomenon, we know surprisingly little about so‐called smart cities, particularly in terms of what the label ideologically reveals as well as hides. Due to its lack of definitional precision, not to mention an underlying self‐congratulatory tendency, the main thrust of this article is to provide a preliminary critical polemic against some of the more rhetorical aspects of smart cities. The primary focus is on the labelling process adopted by some designated smart cities, with a view to problematizing a range of elements that supposedly characterize this new urban form, as well as question some of the underlying assumptions/contradictions hidden within the concept. To aid this critique, the article explores to what extent labelled smart cities can be understood as a high‐tech variation of the ‘entrepreneurial city’, as well as speculates on some general principles which would make them more progressive and inclusive.},

I describe how the growth of big data is shifting the emphasis from longer term strategic planning to short-term thinking about how cities function and can be managed, although with the possibility that over much longer periods of time, this kind of big data will become a source for information about every time horizon.

	abstract = {Conventional studies of bilateral trade patterns specify a log-normal gravity equation for empirical estimation. However, the log-normal gravity equation suffers from three problems: the bias created by the logarithmic transformation, the failure of the homoskedasticity assumption, and the way zero values are treated. These problems normally result in biased and inefficient estimates. Recently, the Poisson specification of the trade gravity model has received attention as an alternative to the log-normality assumption (Santos Silva \& Tenreyro, 2006). However, the standard Poisson model is vulnerable for problems of overdispersion and excess zero flows. To overcome these problems, this paper considers modified Poisson fixed-effects estimations (negative binomial, zero-inflated). Extending the empirical model put forward by Santos Silva \& Tenreyro (2006), we show how these techniques may provide viable alternatives to both the log-normal and standard Poisson specification of the gravity model of trade. Caractéristiques du modèle de gravité du commerce: zéros, zéros en excès et estimation du zéro-inflated Résumé Des études conventionnelles sur la structure des échanges commerciaux bilatéraux définissent une équation de gravité log-normale pour estimation empirique. Cependant, l’équation de gravité log-normale souffre de trois problèmes: le biais créé par la transformation logarithmique, l’échec de l'hypothèse d'homoscédasticité, et la manière dont sont traitées les valeurs zéro. Ces problèmes conduisent en général à des estimations biaisées et inefficaces. La spécification de Poisson du modèle de gravité du commerce a récemment retenu l'attention en tant qu'alternative à l'hypothèse de log-normalité (Santos Silva et Tenreyro, 2006). Toutefois, le modèle standard de Poisson est vulnérable en ce qui concerne les problèmes d'hyperdispersion et de flux d'excès en zéro. Afin de surmonter ces problèmes, cet article considère des estimations de Poisson modifiées à effets fixes (binomiale négative, zéro-inflated). En élargissant ce modèle empirique rapporté par Santos Silva et Tenreyro (2006), nous démontrons que ces techniques peuvent apporter des méthodes alternatives viables à la spécification log-normale, ainsi qu’à la spécification Poisson standard du modèle de gravité du commerce. Sobre la especificación del modelo de gravedad del comercio: estimaciones cero, cero en exceso y cero infladas Résumén Los estudios convencionales de patrones de comercio bilateral especifican una ecuación de gravedad log-normal para la estimación empírica. No obstante, la ecuación de gravedad log-normal tiene tres problemas: el sesgo creado por la transformación logarítmica, el fracaso de la suposición de homocedasticidad, y la forma en que se tratan los valores cero. Estos problemas generalmente arrojan estimaciones sesgadas e ineficientes. Recientemente, la especificación Poisson del modelo de gravedad del comercio ha recibido atención como una alternativa a la suposición de log-normalidad (Santos Silva y Tenreyro, 2006). Sin embargo, el modelo Poisson estándar es vulnerable por problemas de sobredispersión y exceso de flujos cero. Para superar estos problemas, este estudio considera las estimaciones modificadas Poisson de efecto fijo (binomial negativa, cero-infladas). Al extender el modelo empírico propuesto por Santos Silva y Tenreyro (2006), mostramos que estas técnicas pueden proporcionar alternativas viables para especificaciones log-normal y Poisson estándar del modelo de gravedad del comercio.},

	abstract = {This chapter analyzes the distribution of geocoded social media data (also referred to as a cyberscape) that references “beer” and related terms. Drawing upon an ongoing research project that archives every geocoded tweet in the world, this chapter explores differences in the frequency and geographic distribution of the everyday commentary made by Twitter users about beer. While the sheer volume of activity, close to a million geocoded beer tweets in 2012, is notable in its own right, it is only when comparisons between subsets of the data are made that the most intriguing spatial patterns emerge. In order to showcase these patterns of differences within online social media, this chapter compares beer tweets to twitter commentary on other topics, i.e., contrasting the geography of wine and beer tweets as well as examining differences within the online conversations about beer, i.e., how do references to light beers or regional “cheap” beers vary over space. These geographical differences (e.g., where are the hot spots for “beer” vs. “wine” or “Bud Light” versus “Coors Light”) illuminates how the commentary and views expressed online, reflect offline practices and preferences. In short, the visualization of “beer space” produced by mapping tweets represents the complex intertwining of offline preferences for specific brews which are expressed via an online practice of presenting ones views.},

In fact, they are the antithesis of supermarket ubiquity, price sensitivity, wide product/service range and extended opening hours. So, despite their small role in total food retail sales, why are they a growing presence and what do farmers' markets say about the consumer needs that supermarkets do not satisfy? This article reports the findings of a questionnaire-based survey of 391 farmers' market customers in five Scottish towns during 2006. Customers were seeking high quality food products, even if that meant premium prices, and put a particular value on direct transactions with the producer. Although these data have a specific geographic context, they have resonance for the growing schism between producer and customer in the UK and other countries.},

	abstract = {“Smart cities” grew out of the realization that North American models of suburban development and central business district decline needed to be challenged with new paradigms. This movement began in the 1990s with ideas centered on smart growth and new urbanism. While initially restricted to small, wealthy cities, the ideas that emerged during this period combined with a vertiginous growth in information technologies to create software-driven urban managerial tools for major cities. The increasing “technologization” of urban systems that automatically replicate spatial dynamics has been on the agenda of urban scholars for some time. However, the relatively new paradigms of “whole system” implementation in large urban centers has not been the subject of robust critical engagement. The aim of this paper is to examine critically the implementation and functioning of two “smart cities” systems in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil as part of the city's broader preparations for hosting the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 Olympic Games.},

	abstract = {Smart city initiatives have been adopted by cities worldwide, proposing forward-looking, technological solutions to urban problems big and small. These policies are indicative of a digitized urban condition, where social and economic exchange rely on globalized telecommunications networks, and governance strategies follow suit. Propelled through events such as IBM’s Smarter Cities Challenge, the smart city acts as a data-driven logic urban change where widespread benefit to a city and its residents is proposed, masking the utility of these policies to further entrepreneurial economic development strategies. In this article, I present a case study of the Digital On-Ramps initiative that emerged from IBM’s policy-consultation in Philadelphia. The initiative proposed a social media-style workforce education application (app) to train up to 500,000 low-literacy residents for jobs in the information and knowledge economy, but even as the city’s mayor declared the project a success, it did not meet expectations. This essay argues that the rhetoric of intelligent, transformative digital change works much more to “sell” a city in the global economy than to actually address urban inequalities.},

Hierarchical decisionmaking violates the Independence from Irrelevant Alternatives property embedded in the theoretical derivation of the production-constrained gravity model from choice axioms. Various aspects of gravity model misspecification resulting from hierarchical destination choice are investigated and an empirical example is given in terms of US migrants. A discussion is presented of several destination choice models that are more accurately specified than the gravity formulation when destination choice is hierarchical. The recently derived competing destinations formulation is shown to be amongst the most useful in this respect. The discussion is framed in the context of discrete choice theory.},

	abstract = {Abstract Traditional migration modelling involves an estimation of a migration model, using population at origin, population at destination, distance and other social, economic and environmental variables to explain migration flows. Modelling performance is assessed for the migration model as a whole. However, it remains unclear if a migration model can fit the relative emissiveness and attractiveness of specific regions better than the spatial interaction effect between pairs of regions. Recent studies show that the parameters of the log?linear model for a migration matrix can fully describe the relative emissiveness Pi, attractiveness Qj of specific regions and the spatial interaction effect between pairs of regions Fij. By calculating and comparing the contributions of the modelling errors of the relative emissiveness Pi, attractiveness Qj and the spatial interaction effect Fij to the overall modelling errors of migration flows, this paper reveals which factors of the migration process can be modelled more or less accurately using the case of regional migration in China for the period 2005?2010. According to the Poisson migration model for China, the modelling errors of the constant K, the relative attractiveness and emissiveness caused mean relative errors of 4.92\%, 11.80\% and 10.61\% in migration flows, respectively. The spatial interaction caused a mean relative error of 17.74\% in migration flows, which was much greater than the errors caused by the constant K, the relative attractiveness and emissiveness. Thus, the spatial interaction is the most important factor, which cannot be modelled very well in migration modelling. Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Sustainable development is used here as a common notion referring to those persistent problems in (Western industrialized) societies that can only be dealt with on the very long term (decades or more) through specific types of network and decision-making processes. Based on interdisciplinary research into complex processes of long term, structural change in society, basic tenets for complexity-based governance are formulated. These tenets are translated into a framework that distinguishes between four different types of governance activities and their respective roles in societal transitions. This framework can be used for implementation of governance strategies and instruments. The approach and framework have been developed deductively and inductively in the Netherlands since 2000. This article presents the theoretical basis of transition management and will be illustrated by examples from transition management practice, especially the Dutch national energy transition program.},

Sutton (Sunk costs and market structure: price competition, advertising, and the evolution of concentration, 1991) points to technology and advertising races as two key drivers of market concentration. This study uses an own-built longitudinal data set of the population of firms and breweries, and reveals the importance of institutional factors in explaining the dynamics of market structure. The practice of tying outlets to brewers and legal restrictions on opening retail outlets, together with a permissive policy towards mergers, made acquisition of medium-sized firms and brewery closure (shortly after acquisition) the main driving mechanism towards industry consolidation. During this period, the number of firms and plants fell sharply (by 74\% and 60\%, respectively) and production rose (by about 25\%), with no firm entry and just one new brewery opening. As a result, concentration increased and the market transformed from a highly fragmented one into a stable oligopoly.},

The classification uses cluster analysis to reduce 41 census variables to a single socio-economic indicator. The classification was made available with a host of supporting and descriptive information as a National Statistic via National Statistics on line. The classification forms part of a suite of area classifications that were produced by the Office for National Statistics from 2001 census data.

	abstract = {Van Imhoff (Evert), Post (Wendy). - Microsimulation methods for population projections Microsimulation differs from traditional macrosimulation in using a sample rather than the total population, in operating at the level of individual data rather than aggregated data, and in being based on repeated random experiments rather than average numbers. Here are presented the circumstances in which microsimulation can be of greater value than the more conventional methods. It is particularly relevant when the results of the process being studied are complex whereas the forces driving it are simple. A particular problem in microsimulation results from the fact that the projections are subject to random variation. Various sources of random variations are examined but the most important is the one we refer to as specification randomness: the more explanatory variables are included in the model, the greater the degree of random variation affecting the output of the model. After a brief survey of the microsimulation models which exist in demography, a number of the essential characteristics of microsimulation are illustrated using the KINSIM model for projecting the future size and structure of kinship networks.},

	abstract = {Clustering algorithms are attractive for the task of class identification in spatial databases. However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR-ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.},

This paper estimates the effects of changing parameters in migration models and the changing demographic, social, and economic attributes in origin and destinations on migration flows. A decomposition approach is developed based on multilevel Poisson migration models. Multilevel Poisson migration models are estimated for migration in China for the periods 1985–1990 and 1995–2000. Overall, the total inter-provincial migration was increased by 22 million in China from 1985–1990 to 1995–2000. The decomposition result shows that 62.28\% of this increase was due to changes in the value of explanatory variables, while 37.72\% was due to changes in the value of model parameters.},

Yet these changes do not happen in isolation: the students are also associated with major migration flows into and out of studentified parts of cities. I examine the migration flows associated with a set of wards selected on the basis of having a high concentration of students. Examination of the age profiles of migrants into and out of these wards supports an argument that assumptions can be made that, for most of the selected wards, in-migrants are predominantly new students entering the system, whilst out-migrants are predominantly recently graduated students leaving the system. The specific origins from which new students arrive, and destinations to which former students depart, are examined and mapped, and the role of higher education as a mechanism through which the South East of England gains qualified workers is considered.},

Beer encompasses different types (e.g. ales and lagers), styles (e.g. amber ale, barley wine, Hefeweizen, IPA, pilsner, stout) and varieties of styles. To date, the Brewers Association has classified more than 140 different styles of beer (Brewers Association, 2012). Even the most discerning palette would be hard pressed to differentiate that many styles and varieties of ales and lagers. So how can such a simple beverage be so complex? In a word—geography.},

	abstract = {Street imagery is a promising big data source providing current and historical images in more than 100 countries. Previous studies used this data to audit built environment features. Here we explore a novel application, using Google Street View (GSV) to predict travel patterns at the city level. We sampled 34 cities in Great Britain. In each city, we accessed GSV images from 1000 random locations from years overlapping with the 2011 Census and the 2011-2013 Active People Survey (APS). We manually annotated images into seven categories of road users. We developed regression models with the counts of images of road users as predictors. Outcomes included Census-reported commute shares of four modes (walking plus public transport, cycling, motorcycle, and car), and APS-reported past-month participation in walking and cycling. In bivariate analyses, we found high correlations between GSV counts of cyclists (GSV-cyclists) and cycle commute mode share (r=0.92) and past-month cycling (r=0.90). Likewise, GSV-pedestrians was moderately correlated with past-month walking for transport (r=0.46), GSV-motorcycles was moderately correlated with commute share of motorcycles (r=0.44), and GSV-buses was highly correlated with commute share of walking plus public transport (r=0.81). GSV-car was not correlated with car commute mode share (r=-0.12). However, in multivariable regression models, all mode shares were predicted well. Cross-validation analyses showed good prediction performance for all the outcomes except past-month walking. Street imagery is a promising new big data source to predict urban mobility patterns. Further testing across multiple settings is warranted both for cross-sectional and longitudinal assessments.},

	abstract = {The misspecification of gravity spatial interaction models has recently been described by the author. The bias in parameter estimates that results from such misspecification appears to produce the 'map pattern effect' or 'spatial structure bias' in estimated distance-decay parameters. A further aspect of the misspecification bias in gravity parameter estimates is explored here. The severity of the bias is shown to vary in a predictable manner with variations in spatial structure. In particular, the bias is shown to be dependent upon the pattern of accessibility that exists with a spatial system. The relevant aspects of this pattern are discussed for intraurban and interurban (or interregional) flow matrices. It is shown that from an examination of the spatial structure of centres in a spatial system it is possible, a priori, to identify whether significant bias will arise in the calibration of a gravity model. Certain configurations of centres are shown theoretically to produce maximal bias. The author thus answers the question, "why do gravity parameter estimates appear to be biased in some systems but not in others?"},

Some of these analyses may involve complex modeling, including interactions and nonlinear relations. Identifying such relations and encoding them in imputation models, for example, in the conditional regressions for multiple imputation via chained equations, can be daunting tasks with large numbers of categorical and continuous variables. The authors present a nonparametric approach for implementing multiple imputation via chained equations by using sequential regression trees as the conditional models. This has the potential to capture complex relations with minimal tuning by the data imputer. Using simulations, the authors demonstrate that the method can result in more plausible imputations, and hence more reliable inferences, in complex settings than the naive application of standard sequential regression imputation techniques. They apply the approach to impute missing values in data on adverse birth outcomes with more than 100 clinical and survey variables. They evaluate the imputations using posterior predictive checks with several epidemiologic analyses of interest.},

During this time, the larger, national brewing companies expanded through merger and acquisition, and increasingly standardized the products offered in markets across the country. More recently, a microbrewing renaissance emerged in the mid-1980s, which saw dramatic growth of new, small scale, craft brewers oriented principally to local markets again. The new microbreweries often invoke geography and place in their branding and marketing strategies, to emphasize their connection to their locations. This strategy is known as ‘neolocalism’, and it is evident that microbreweries are much more likely to use this strategy than the national brewing companies. This chapter documents some of the ways in which Canadian microbreweries use neolocalism to connect to place, and through an analysis of brewery and beer brand names, demonstrates the difference in tendency of microbreweries versus national brewing companies to do so. In addition, the response of the national brewing companies to the new competition from microbreweries reveals a new approach to merger and acquisition—one which embraces neolocalism and place-connection.},

The most prominent behavioural theories used as decision rules are the random utility theory, as implemented in the discrete choice model, and the theory of planned behaviour. We identify the critical choices that must be made in developing an ABM, namely the modelling of decision processes and social networks. We also discuss two challenges that hamper the widespread use of ABM in the study of migration and, more broadly, demography and the social sciences: (a) the choice and the operationalisation of a behavioural theory (decision-making and social interaction) and (b) the selection of empirical evidence to validate the model. We offer advice on how these challenges might be overcome.},

In contrast to the traditional models where individual characteristics are often blurred or even disregarded, MSM provides the realistic disaggregated information that is often vital for modern policy problems. MSM has been extensively applied and well tested in social modeling. However, it has been criticized for being less strong in modeling interactions between individuals and individual behaviors. MSM also struggles where realistic micro data are not available. Agent-based models (ABMs) can model the demographic process through interactions between the agents and with the environment that they live in. The combination of MSM and ABM provides a new approach to enhance complex social modeling. In our study, we attempt to provide better groundwork to facilitate policy and decision making for the U.K. population through a hybrid model that combines the strength of the two complementary techniques.},

	abstract = {We analyze the passengers' traffic pattern for 1.58 million taxi trips of Shanghai, China. By employing the non-negative matrix factorization and optimization methods, we find that, people travel on workdays mainly for three purposes: commuting between home and workplace, traveling from workplace to workplace, and others such as leisure activities. Therefore, traffic flow in one area or between any pair of locations can be approximated by a linear combination of three basis flows, corresponding to the three purposes respectively. We name the coefficients in the linear combination as traffic powers, each of which indicates the strength of each basis flow. The traffic powers on different days are typically different even for the same location, due to the uncertainty of the human motion. Therefore, we provide a probability distribution function for the relative deviation of the traffic power. This distribution function is in terms of a series of functions for normalized binomial distributions. It can be well explained by statistical theories and is verified by empirical data. These findings are applicable in predicting the road traffic, tracing the traffic pattern and diagnosing the traffic related abnormal events. These results can also be used to infer land uses of urban area quite parsimoniously.},

	abstract = {In the presence of strong economies of scale, a fall in transport costs can lead to a more pronounced geographical concentration of production. This is very apparent in the growing concentration of breweries in England from 1900-1970. The number of breweries in England fell sharply between 1900 and 1970, and so also did the range of locations in which they were located. In 1900, many small villages could boast a brewery of their own, but by 1970, the vast majority of breweries were located in towns and cities. However, as the number of discerning consumers has grown, with a pronounced taste for horizontal product variety, the tendency towards geographical concentration has declined in the last forty years. The consumer group CAMRA, arguably the most successful consumer group ever formed, has been instrumental in educating English beer drinkers to appreciate horizontal product differentiation in beers and ales. Since the foundation of CAMRA in 1971, we have seen many new micro-breweries enter the industry, and a rapidly increasing geographical dispersion of these micro-breweries.},

It also identifies the main dimensions and elements characterizing a smart city. The different metrics of urban smartness are reviewed to show the need for a shared definition of what constitutes a smart city, what are its features, and how it performs in comparison to traditional cities. Furthermore, performance measures and initiatives in a few smart cities are identified.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing technology has great potential for acquisition of detailed and accurate land-use information for management and planning of urban regions. However, the determination of land-use data with high geometric and thematic accuracy is generally limited by the availability of adequate remote sensing data, in terms of spatial and temporal resolution, and digital image analysis techniques. This study introduces a methodology using information on image spatial form—landscape metrics—to describe urban land-use structures and land-cover changes that result from urban growth. The analysis is based on spatial analysis of land-cover structures mapped from digitally classified aerial photographs of the urban region Santa Barbara, CA. Landscape metrics were calculated for segmented areas of homogeneous urban land use to allow a further characterization of the land use of these areas. The results show a useful separation and characterization of three urban land-use types: commercial development, high-density residential, and low-density residential. Several important structural land-cover features were identified for this study. These were: the dominant general land cover (built up or vegetation), the housing density, the mean structure and plot size, and the spatial aggregation of built-up areas. For two test areas in the Santa Barbara region, changes (urban growth) in the urban spatial land-use structure can be described and quantified with landscape metrics. In order to discriminate more accurately between the three land-cover types of interest, the landscape metrics were further refined into what are termed ‘landscape metric signatures’ for the land-use categories. The analysis shows the importance of the spatial measurements as second-order image information that can contribute to more detailed mapping of urban areas and towards a more accurate characterization of spatial urban growth pattern.},

	abstract = {Social reformer Charles Booth undertook a massive survey into the social and economic conditions of the people of London at the end of the 19th century. An important innovation of his Inquiry was the construction of large, detailed maps displaying social class of inner London on a street-by-street basis. These provide a detailed and vivid picture of the geography of poverty and affluence at this time. These maps have been digitised, georeferenced and linked to contemporary ward boundaries allowing Booth's measurement of social class to be matched to the measurement of social class in the 1991 census of population and standardised mortality ratios derived for all causes of death in the survey area between 1991 and 1995. The social class data were used to derive an index of relative poverty for both time periods and a comparison of the geographies of relative poverty and their relationship with contemporary mortality was made. Although the overall standard of living had increased, the geography of poverty at the end of the 19th century was very similar to that at the end of the 20th century. Moreover, the geography of all causes of death for people over the age of 65 was more strongly related to the geography of poverty in the late 19th century than contemporary patterns of poverty. This relationship was also true for mortality for specific diseases that are related to deprivation in early life. The paper concludes that the spatial patterns of poverty in inner London are extremely robust and a century of change has failed to disrupt it.},

This is a family of interrelated phenomena: the vital transition, which is concerned with the dynamics of fertility and mortality; the mobility transition, which encompasses change in the character, rate, and significance of migration and circulation along with vicarious movements undertaken by means of communication; and other transitions not yet formally described. Five successive phases are postulated for the mobility transition. Four phases have already been experienced, most notably in Western Europe and northeastern North America, and a fifth is predicted for the immediate future. The available evidence tends to support the hypothesis and to confirm the supposition that the diffusion of sequential phases outward through space and forward through time has appreciably accelerated in recent years.},

It concludes, first, that industrializing areas of the north emerged as a competitor for potential migrants—contributing relatively fewer migrants than predicted by the model. Rising wage rates in these areas appear to explain this phenomenon. Second, it argues that migration from urban centres in the west midlands and parts of the West Country, including Bristol, Birmingham, and Worcester, was substantially higher than predicted, and that this is largely explained by falling wage rates and the evolution of an increasingly efficient travel network. Third, for the counties within about 130 kilometres of the capital, this article suggests that migration followed the pattern described in the current literature, with London drawing large numbers of local women in particular. It also argues that these short-distance migrants came from a uniquely wide number of parishes, suggesting a direct rural-to-urban path.},

	abstract = {In the urban resurgence accompanying the growth of the knowledge economy, second-order cities appear to be losing out to the principal city, especially where the latter is much larger and benefits from substantially greater agglomeration economies. The view that any city can make itself attractive to creative talent seems at odds with the idea of a country having just one ‘escalator region’ where the rate of career progression is much faster, especially for in-migrants. This paper takes the case of England, with its highly primate city-size distribution, and tests how its second-order cities (in size order, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, Bristol, Sheffield, Liverpool, Nottingham, and Leicester) compare with London as human-capital escalators. The analysis is based on the Office for National Statistics Longitudinal Survey of linked census records for 1991–2001 and uses one key indicator of upward social mobility – the transition from White Collar Non-core to White Collar Core. For non-migrants, the transition rate for the second-order cities combined is found to fall well short of London's, but in one case – Manchester – the rate is significantly higher than the rest of the country outside the Greater South East. Those moving to the second-order cities during the decade experienced much stronger upward social mobility than their non-migrants, but this ‘migrant premium’ was generally similar to that for London, suggesting that it results from people moving only after they have secured a better job. Second-order cities, therefore, cannot rely on the speculative migration of talented people but need suitable jobs ready for them to access. © 2013 The Authors. Population, Space and Place.

Technological change and the continued success of Anheuser–Busch forced the macro brewers into a war-of-attrition game and contributed to rising concentration in the macro sector of the industry. Homogenization of the beer produced by macro brewers, changes in local demand conditions, and a more favorable regulatory environment created profitable niches in many local markets for micro brewery beer, and entry into this sector occurred at a phenomenal rate from 1977 to 1998. Consistent with several models of industry dynamics, over-exuberance led to a shakeout as the number of micro breweries fell by over 16\% from 1998 to 2002.},

This in turn means that the migration researcher must not only look at the effects of policy and changes in policy, important though this is, but must also attempt to understand the changing political factors which fuel the formation of policy. This paper aims to bring together some of the wide variety of policy issues and responses which may be observed in Europe at the present time and in the recent past, and in particular to make an assessment of the approaches being taken by the European Union member states as a whole, and also by the so-called Schengen group of member states. This article also attempts to look at the perceptions of these policies and their effects from the point of view of both the "western" and the "eastern" European countries, as migration policy issues are rarely one-sided. In conclusion, it considers some of the research issues and problems which are raised by geographers and others working in this area, difficulties which might be implied by our possibly flippant title, "Keeping Up with Schengen."},

In this paper our purpose is to suggest that the opportunities for new firm formation and growth arising from such changes may be more circumscribed than have hitherto been acknowledged. Drawing upon evidence from the UK brewing industry, which has seen the creation of many hundreds of new breweries during the past twenty years, we highlight the role of distribution channels as a significant barrier to the growth of the small-business sector. Changes to the regulatory environment (the Beer Orders) in an attempt by government to improve the competitiveness of the UK brewing industry have, paradoxically, had the opposite effect to that intended, and so have failed to increase market opportunities for microbrewers. Future research must give greater attention to the role of distribution in order to achieve a better understanding of the changing structure and spatial organisation of production.},

However, the rise of craft breweries and their perceived foci on environmental, economic and/or social sustainability trends have promulgated a “greening” in the beer industry at local to global scales. To assess the geographies of sustainability in the craft beer industry, we distributed a mixed method survey to all regional craft breweries in the United States. Overall, more sustainable practices have been adopted at various levels of the craft beer production, including the reduction of water and energy use and increased energy efficiency, the use of organic or local ingredients, and the incorporation of a culture that promotes sustainability. These and related findings showcase certain sustainability trends and practices being adopted by regional craft breweries in the United States.},

The family of spatial interaction models due to Wilson is first outlined, and then some existing calibration methods are briefly reviewed. A procedure for deriving best statistics based on the principle of maximum-likelihood is then developed from the work of Hyman and Evans, and the methodology is illustrated using the example of a retail gravity model. Five methods for solving the maximum-likelihood equations are outlined: procedures based on a simple first-order iterative process, the Newton - Raphson method for several variables, multivariate Fibonacci search, search using the Simplex method, and search based on quadratic convergence, are all tested and compared. It appears that the Newton - Raphson method is the most efficient, and this is further tested in the calibration of disaggregated residential location models.},

	abstract = {Since the emergence of modern day geodemographics, population geography has
witnessed a renaissance in the area of policy related spatial analysis. These classifications
group areas on the basis of similarity into cluster units which define their demographic and
social characteristics. The methods used to create these systems combine geographic
thought and theory with statistical manipulations of multivariate data.
There is currently paucity in the development and use of geodemographic systems in
developing countries due to multiple related factors particularly data availability and
access.
This thesis argues that the developing world has a lot to benefit from geodemographic
systems especially in areas of public policy making. The aim of the thesis is to provide a
comprehensive description of the decisions made during the creation of two area
segmentation systems - one for Nigeria and the other for the Philippines. The systems are
accompanied by detailed user guides with visuals and pen portraits
In addition to developing the two systems, examples of how the systems can be used to
inform policy are presented in the areas of education, gender parity and maternal and child
health care.
It is hoped that the creation of these systems will mark the beginning of a long awaited
proliferation of geodemographic systems to developing countries.},

While beer and other perishable foodstuffs were historically produced for local consumer markets, new technologies, distribution networks, and multi-national corporations have changed the market considerably and the result has been the dominance of a few large macro breweries serving global consumer demands. Yet, the emergence of new niche markets and the success of micro-brews has resulted in an explosion of regional and local craft production facilities and a renewed emphasis on local water-streams, springs, and lakes. In this paper, we examine the iconography and observed “hydro-geography” of selected local, regional, and even national products to understand the intersection between place and industry, and the geopsychology of competitive marketing strategies and stratagems.},

	abstract = {Background Research on ethnic differentials in mortality in England and Wales has focused on immigrants because, until now, studies collecting data on ethnicity have not covered sufficient deaths to investigate the subject. International migrants are selected for good health and tend to have low mortality.Methods We investigated all-cause mortality at ages 1−79 in 1991−2005 by self-reported ethnicity and country of birth. The data are from the Office for National Statistics Longitudinal Study of England and Wales for the cohort aged 0−64 in 1991 (n=436 195). Poisson regression was used to adjust the estimates for metropolitan residence and three indicators of socioeconomic status.Results White, Black Caribbean, Other Asian and Other immigrants all had lower mortality than Whites born in the UK. Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Chinese immigrants had lower mortality than the UK-born Whites living in similar circumstances to them. By contrast, the UK-born Black Caribbean group had higher mortality (RR=1.38, 95\% CI 1.03 to 1.86) than the UK-born Whites. This excess mortality was accounted for by their low socioeconomic status. Within the Black Caribbean population, the UK-born individuals had significantly higher mortality than those born abroad whether or not the estimates were adjusted for socioeconomic status and metropolitan residence. Adjusting exposure time for undocumented emigration made little difference to the estimates.Conclusions Immigrants are selected for good health. This has offset the impact of socioeconomic disadvantage on the mortality of minority ethnic groups. As the immigrant population ages and the UK-born minority ethnic population grows, ethnic differentials in all-cause mortality are likely to change.},

The present exploratory study examines these current developments from the perspective of six “nascent” entrepreneurs. Participants' responses suggest the promising potential that a state craft-beer sector represents a niche market, also using locally brewed craft-beer in combination with food as drawing cards that may additionally lead to the development of beer tourism in the state. Respondents are in agreement, however, that more changes are needed in the current legislature, but continue to occur very slowly, thereby limiting their potential, growth and ultimately their success. Given the paucity of research on micro-brewing from an entrepreneurial perspective, the study provides new insights that could be further explored in future studies.},

This paper reviews the contemporary literature for integrated planning and design at and around stations and derives a set of analytical criteria which are used to evaluate the policy context for a new railway project in East London: the East London Line Extension. Conclusions are drawn as to whether the principles of good practice are being adhered to and the likelihood of the stations and their environs becoming exemplars of good practice for others to follow.},

	abstract = {In offering particular intrinsic rewards, craftwork has been situated in recent debates as a possible antidote to some of the alienating features of work in modern capitalist societies. The revival of traditional beer in the UK, led by the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA), has provided the context in which a proliferation of small-scale breweries has emerged. Using insights drawn from qualitative interviews, this article explores the occupational identity of brewers working in such small-scale breweries. Their accounts foreground notions of skill and passion where both are intertwined to produce the brewer identity. Brewer identity is described as being embodied, felt and performed through the working on and with ingredients and equipment at the brewery. It is suggested that the tangibility of both the process involved and the product produced mean that significant intrinsic value is derived from the embodied craft of brewing. Thus, being engaged in the material processes of the brewery and, in the finished beer, being able to see a tangible reflection of one’s labour in the final product highlights the ways in which brewers draw meaningful rewards from the affective and embodied facets of skilled craft work.},

	abstract = {Recently, it has been argued that migration models in which ordinary least squares regression is used are inappropriate, because the dependent variable (number of migrants) is a count. Instead, a Poisson regression approach can be adopted. Goodness of fit can be evaluated by using a deviance (log-likelihood) or X2statistic, whose significance can be compared with a X2 distribution with appropriate degrees of freedom. In this paper, such an approach is used to model ward-level migration flows within the county of Hereford and Worcester. However, it is shown that for this exceedingly sparse data set the deviance figures attained are very low, suggesting that there may be a problem of underdispersion. This is in contrast to the overdispersion which has been identified as a common problem in Poisson models. The low deviance figures arise from the large number of zeros and small flows in the data matrix, which invalidate the usual X2 goodness-of-fit test. A simulation approach to the assessment of model goodness of fit is suggested, and the results from applying it to the Hereford and Worcester data set are described.},

Barley was the common cereal used by beer-makers (those outside of southern Italy and Greece), while wheat was also used in much of western Europe as a secondary cereal while millet instead was used in the east. Although many types of plant additives were no doubt used in beer, two main ones became popular: sweet gale, first attested in the region of the Rhine estuary around the first century BC, and hops, first widely popularized in the Ile de France area in the ninth AD. Honey too was often used in beer throughout western Europe, except perhaps for the Iberian peninsula and Ireland. It must be stressed that this picture is based on highly fragmentary evidence, and it may be incorrect in many particulars. It may be hoped that future archaeological discoveries will add much to our knowledge.},

ABM allows the disaggregation of systems into individual components that can potentially have their own characteristics and rule sets. This is a powerful paradigm that can be exploited through simulation to further our knowledge of the workings of geographical systems. We present in this chapter an overview of ABM; the main features of an agent-based model are given, along with a discussion of what constitutes an agent-based model. The distinction between cellular automata (CA), microsimulation (MSM) and agent-based models are discussed along with the advantages and limitations of ABM for modelling geographical systems.

Using the English brewing industry (1945–1960) as a case study, size and conventional performance criteria of taken-over, independent and merging firms are assessed, and shown not to be valid target indicators. Comparison of a real estate/property utilization parameter – average asset value per “tied house” – for each firm category, shows that taken-over firms have the lowest average asset value per tied house. Low average asset value per house characterizes firms which, by failing to optimize their property assets, are poor performers. Takeover therefore, in this case, targets the “correct” firms.},

Also supports three-dimensional point patterns, space-time point patterns in any number of dimensions, and point patterns on a linear network.
Contains over 2000 functions for plotting spatial data, exploratory data analysis, model-fitting, simulation, spatial sampling, model diagnostics, and formal inference.
Data types include point patterns, line segment patterns, spatial windows, pixel images, tessellations, and linear networks.
Exploratory methods include quadrat counts, K-functions and their simulation envelopes, nearest neighbour distance and empty space statistics, Fry plots, pair correlation function, kernel smoothed intensity, relative risk estimation with cross-validated bandwidth selection, mark correlation functions, segregation indices, mark dependence diagnostics, and kernel estimates of covariate effects. Formal hypothesis tests of random pattern (chi-squared, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Diggle-Cressie-Loosmore-Ford, Dao-Genton) and tests for covariate effects (Cox-Berman-Waller-Lawson, Kolmogorov-Smirnov) are also supported.
Parametric models can be fitted to point pattern data using the functions ppm(), kppm(), slrm(), dppm() similar to glm(). Types of models include Poisson, Gibbs and Cox point processes, Neyman-Scott cluster processes, and determinantal point processes. Models may involve dependence on covariates, inter-point interaction, cluster formation and dependence on marks. Models are fitted by maximum likelihood, logistic regression, minimum contrast, and composite likelihood methods.
A model can be fitted to a list of point patterns (replicated point pattern data) using the function mppm(). The model can include random effects and fixed effects depending on the experimental design, in addition to all the features listed above.
Fitted point process models can be simulated, automatically. Formal hypothesis tests of a fitted model are supported (likelihood ratio test, analysis of deviance, Monte Carlo tests) along with basic tools for model selection (stepwise(), AIC()). Tools for validating the fitted model include simulation envelopes, residuals, residual plots and Q-Q plots, leverage and influence diagnostics, partial residuals, and added variable plots.},

Modeling results highlight the role of regional economic disparity and migration stock, as well as the gravity variables of population and distance, in explaining migration flows. Over time, the effect of regional disparity has increased, while that of distance decreased.

	abstract = {Population migration is a major determinant of an area's age-sex structure and socio-economic characteristics. The suggestion that migration can contribute to an increase or decrease in place-specific rates of illness is not new. However, differences in health status between small geographical locations that may be affected by the inter-relationships between health, area-based deprivation and migration are under-researched. Using the Office for National Statistics (ONS) England and Wales Longitudinal Study (LS) 1971-1991, this research tracks individuals to identify any systematic sorting of people that has contributed to the area-level relationships between health (limiting long-term illness and mortality) and deprivation (Carstairs quintiles). The results demonstrate that among the young, migrants are generally healthier than non-migrants. Migrants who move from more to less deprived locations are healthier than migrants who move from less to more deprived locations. Within less deprived areas migrants are healthier than non-migrants but within deprived areas migrants are less healthy than non-migrants. Over the 20 year period, the largest absolute flow is by relatively healthy migrants moving away from more deprived areas towards less deprived areas. The effect is to raise ill-health and mortality rates in the origins and lower them in the destinations. This is reinforced by a significant group of people in poor health who move from less to more deprived locations. In contrast, a small group of unhealthy people moved away from more deprived into less deprived areas. These countercurrents of less healthy people have a slight ameliorating effect on the health-deprivation relationship. Whilst health-deprivation relationships are more marked for migrants there are also health (dis-) benefits for non-migrants if their location becomes relatively more or less deprived over time. Overall we found that between 1971 and 1991, inequalities in health increased between the least and most deprived areas, compared with the health-deprivation relationship which would have existed if peoples' locations and deprivation patterns had stayed geographically constant. Migration, rather than changes in the deprivation of the area that non-migrants live in, accounts for the large majority of change.},

The British Census publishes migration statistics only for flows exceeding a certain threshold and the first exercise performed in this paper attempts to discover these thresholded flows. This complete migration matrix is then used as an input into a second exercise designed to disaggregate the flow pattern according to the type of mover. Finally, a means of assessing the goodness of fit of the entropy maximising model is advanced.},

First, a seminal examination of asymmetry in regionally disaggregated UK house prices is undertaken. Secondly, data are examined which are further disaggregated according to the age, or vintage, of the housing stock. However, the major development concerns the application of a non-parametric testing approach to detect cyclical asymmetry. In contrast to previously employed tests in the economics literature, the Triples test employed possesses high power and is not sensitive to outliers. It is found that extensive asymmetry is present in UK house prices, with cyclical peaks typically being greater in magnitude than corresponding troughs. The implications of these findings for the comparison and construction of economic theories of the housing market, the specification of econometric models and the construction and implementation of economic policy are noted.},

An important aspect of these externalities that has not been previously emphasized is that the effects of agglomeration extend over at least three different dimensions. These are the industrial, geographic, and temporal scope of economic agglomeration economies. In each case, the literature suggests that agglomeration economies attenuate with distance. Recently, the literature has also begun to provide evidence on the microfoundations of external economies of scale. The best known of these sources are those attributed to Marshall (1920): labor market pooling, input sharing, and knowledge spillovers. Evidence to date supports the presence of all three of these forces. In addition, there is also evidence that natural advantage, home market effects, consumption opportunities, and rent-seeking all contribute to agglomeration.},

While a significant amount of criminological research has been undertaken in the country, the spatial analysis of crime and offenders, a basic prerequisite for a functional crime management strategy, has not been adequately addressed at a sufficiently fine scale of aggregation. This paper reports on the geodemographic development of offender risk profiles for neighbourhoods in the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality in South Africa. Geodemographics is a relatively new geo-analytical technique that is being increasingly used in policing applications to complement law enforcement techniques and provide further insight into offenders and their offences. Findings of the study indicate that neighbourhoods at a high risk for offender development are amongst the most socially and economically deprived in the municipality and are disproportionately occupied by black Africans. The results highlight a need to reassess the current law enforcement approach to crime reduction in the country and return to the crime prevention initiatives that were part of the National Crime Prevention Strategy of the 1990s.},

	abstract = {Conventional studies of bilateral trade patterns specify a log-normal gravity equation for empirical estimation. However, the log-normal gravity equation suffers from three problems: the bias created by the logarithmic transformation, the failure of the homoskedasticity assumption, and the way zero values are treated. These problems normally result in biased and inefficient estimates. Recently, the Poisson specification of the trade gravity model has received attention as an alternative to the log-normality assumption (Santos Silva \& Tenreyro, 2006). However, the standard Poisson model is vulnerable for problems of overdispersion and excess zero flows. To overcome these problems, this paper considers modified Poisson fixed-effects estimations (negative binomial, zero-inflated). Extending the empirical model put forward by Santos Silva \& Tenreyro (2006), we show how these techniques may provide viable alternatives to both the log-normal and standard Poisson specification of the gravity model of trade. Caractéristiques du modèle de gravité du commerce: zéros, zéros en excès et estimation du zéro-inflated Résumé Des études conventionnelles sur la structure des échanges commerciaux bilatéraux définissent une équation de gravité log-normale pour estimation empirique. Cependant, l’équation de gravité log-normale souffre de trois problèmes: le biais créé par la transformation logarithmique, l’échec de l'hypothèse d'homoscédasticité, et la manière dont sont traitées les valeurs zéro. Ces problèmes conduisent en général à des estimations biaisées et inefficaces. La spécification de Poisson du modèle de gravité du commerce a récemment retenu l'attention en tant qu'alternative à l'hypothèse de log-normalité (Santos Silva et Tenreyro, 2006). Toutefois, le modèle standard de Poisson est vulnérable en ce qui concerne les problèmes d'hyperdispersion et de flux d'excès en zéro. Afin de surmonter ces problèmes, cet article considère des estimations de Poisson modifiées à effets fixes (binomiale négative, zéro-inflated). En élargissant ce modèle empirique rapporté par Santos Silva et Tenreyro (2006), nous démontrons que ces techniques peuvent apporter des méthodes alternatives viables à la spécification log-normale, ainsi qu’à la spécification Poisson standard du modèle de gravité du commerce. Sobre la especificación del modelo de gravedad del comercio: estimaciones cero, cero en exceso y cero infladas Résumén Los estudios convencionales de patrones de comercio bilateral especifican una ecuación de gravedad log-normal para la estimación empírica. No obstante, la ecuación de gravedad log-normal tiene tres problemas: el sesgo creado por la transformación logarítmica, el fracaso de la suposición de homocedasticidad, y la forma en que se tratan los valores cero. Estos problemas generalmente arrojan estimaciones sesgadas e ineficientes. Recientemente, la especificación Poisson del modelo de gravedad del comercio ha recibido atención como una alternativa a la suposición de log-normalidad (Santos Silva y Tenreyro, 2006). Sin embargo, el modelo Poisson estándar es vulnerable por problemas de sobredispersión y exceso de flujos cero. Para superar estos problemas, este estudio considera las estimaciones modificadas Poisson de efecto fijo (binomial negativa, cero-infladas). Al extender el modelo empírico propuesto por Santos Silva y Tenreyro (2006), mostramos que estas técnicas pueden proporcionar alternativas viables para especificaciones log-normal y Poisson estándar del modelo de gravedad del comercio.},

	abstract = {Amidst much discussion of the values and venues of local food, the Farmers’ Market (FM) has emerged as an important, but somewhat uncertain, site of engagement for producers, consumers and local food ‘champions’. Despite the evident certainty of various operational rules, the FM should be seen as a complex and ambiguous space where (contingent) notions of local, quality, authenticity and legitimacy find expression in communications and transactions around food. This paper seeks to extend current reflections on the nature of the contemporary FM and its relationship to the tenets of local food. An empirical analysis involving sellers, shoppers and managers at 15 markets in the Province of Ontario, Canada sought to understand how participants ‘read’ the market as an operating space and subsequently construct the terms of (their) engagement. Findings suggest that Ontario FM customers wish to support farmers and farming via their food-related spending and express attachments to a wide range of alleged benefits pertaining to local food. Yet these values are also malleable in their meaning and amenable to trade-off against other considerations—particularly where social capital is concerned. The notion of ‘local’ emerges as being widely valued but also highly interpretive in its meaning and variable in its absolute importance. The paper concludes with some reflection on the degree to which the findings support, challenge or modify current normative beliefs about local food at the FM.},

Specifically, we utilise a series of unit root tests to examine the null hypothesis of nonstationary HPERs. These include linear tests as well as a nonlinear test and also a test which accounts for abrupt structural change. The results are against the notion of stationary HPERs. This implies that house prices may permanently diverge from earnings.},

	abstract = {Urban performance currently depends not only on a city's endowment of hard infrastructure (physical capital), but also, and increasingly so, on the availability and quality of knowledge communication and social infrastructure (human and social capital). The latter form of capital is decisive for urban competitiveness. Against this background, the concept of the “smart city” has recently been introduced as a strategic device to encompass modern urban production factors in a common framework and, in particular, to highlight the importance of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in the last 20 years for enhancing the competitive profile of a city. The present paper aims to shed light on the often elusive definition of the concept of the “smart city.” We provide a focused and operational definition of this construct and present consistent evidence on the geography of smart cities in the EU27. Our statistical and graphical analyses exploit in depth, for the first time to our knowledge, the most recent version of the Urban Audit data set in order to analyze the factors determining the performance of smart cities. We find that the presence of a creative class, the quality of and dedicated attention to the urban environment, the level of education, and the accessibility to and use of ICTs for public administration are all positively correlated with urban wealth. This result prompts the formulation of a new strategic agenda for European cities that will allow them to achieve sustainable urban development and a better urban landscape.},

Like much of the country, Wisconsin brewers experienced a spatial shift in accordance with the industry’s technology. Starting with many brewers each serving local markets, developments in beer preservation, packaging and transport allowed certain Wisconsin brewers to seize opportunities for expanded market areas. The enlarged economies of scale achieved by these larger brewers provided a competitive advantage that slowly put smaller operations out of business. By the mid-twentieth century, brewing had largely become a national enterprise with fewer local or regional players. Though its market share remained limited, the craft brewing movement represented a reversal of this trend, both nationally and in Wisconsin. Like the early brewers who had settled the state, these new Wisconsin breweries were focused on achieving an economy of scale by developing a local market of consumers.},

	abstract = {The origins and spread of the India Pale Ale (IPA) has geographic themes of immigration, diffusion, and globalization. Flemish immigration to the Kent region of England during the 1500s shortly led to the cultivation of hops, inevitably changing British beers styles. Pale malts produced with advances in industrialization in the latter 1600s later incorporated high levels of hopping rates producing high gravity pale ales and October ales, the ancestors of the IPA. These bitter beers where preferred in Tropical India by British colonists to the sweet dark ales. Soon they spread throughout the British Empire and were imported into North America as well. IPAs became highly copied by breweries across the globe until the late 1880s. German immigration to the U.S. and the global distribution of lagers greatly reduced the IPA’s prominence as lagers were more preferred in tropical environments. The Temperance movement was an ideological act of globalization that discouraged the drinking of high gravity beers. The IPA declined as temperance and rationing for world wars made the high gravity IPAs less acceptable to drink over that of lagers. Later the U.S. would be the new home of the IPA, influenced by West Coast brewers. Citrusy American hops changed the IPA profile and further experimentation has led to hybrid IPAs that reflect a fusion of varying beer styles.},

Yeast literally brings life to beer, contributing distinctive flavors and frothiness. Hops do best at cooler latitudes, and in wetter climates, where soils, day length, temperature, rainfall and terrain all influence regional hop characteristics. Brewing malts are cultivated, mostly, in a cool swath of countries just poleward of 45° north latitude. Mixtures of minerals found in local water supplies impart characteristic flavors and mouth feel to beers brewed there. The geographic combination of variations in yeast, hops, malt and water produce, we argue, a ‘taste of the place’ that one can term the ‘terroir’ of beer. Climate change could, however, modify beer terroir. A warming planet would alter the latitudinal range of future hop and malt cultivation, leading to changes in supplies, quality, and prices.},

	abstract = {The use of wireless location technology and mobile phone data appears to offer a broad range of new opportunities for sophisticated applications in traffic management and monitoring, particularly in the field of incident management. Indeed, due to the high market penetration of mobile phones, it allows the use of very detailed spatial data at lower costs than traditional data collection techniques. Albeit recent, the literature in the field is wide-ranging, although not adequately structured. The aim of this paper is to provide a systematic overview of the main studies and projects addressing the use of data derived from mobile phone networks to obtain location and traffic estimations of individuals, as a starting point for further research on incident and traffic management. The advantages and limitations of the process of retrieving location information and transportation parameters from cellular phones are also highlighted. The issues are presented by providing a description of the current background and data types retrievable from the GSM network. In addition to a literature review, the main findings on the so-called Current City project are presented. This is a test system in Amsterdam (The Netherlands) for the extraction of mobile phone data and for the analysis of the spatial network activity patterns. The main purpose of this project is to provide a full picture of the mobility and area consequences of an incident in near real time to create situation awareness. The first results from this project on how telecom data can be utilized for understanding individual presence and mobility in regular situations and during non-recurrent events where regular flows of people are disrupted by an incident are presented. Furthermore, various interesting studies and projects carried out so far in the field are analyzed, leading to the identification of important research issues related to the use of mobile phone data in transportation applications. Relevant issues concern, on the one hand, factors that influence accuracy, reliability, data quality and techniques used for validation, and on the other hand, the specific role of private mobile companies and transportation agencies.},

After a 100-year decline in the number of United States microbreweries, there has been a remarkable resurgence in the last 15 years. Following on the coattails of Britain's microbrewery revolution, the cultural innovation spread outward from California and has recently affected the Great Plains and the South. One may explain the microbrewery proliferation as a response to changing tastes and a growing beer connoisseur subculture. These are significant elements, but just as important is the neolocal craving that is being satisfied. Cultural geography has much to learn from a careful look at the recent changes in the United States brewing industry.},

The identification of local patterns of spatial association is an important concern in this respect. In this paper, I outline a new general class of local indicators of spatial association (LISA) and show how they allow for the decomposition of global indicators, such as Moran's I, into the contribution of each observation. The LISA statistics serve two purposes. On one hand, they may be interpreted as indicators of local pockets of nonstationarity, or hot spots, similar to the Gi and G*i statistics of Getis and Ord (1992). On the other hand, they may be used to assess the influence of individual locations on the magnitude of the global statistic and to identify “outliers,” as in Anselin's Moran scatterplot (1993a). An initial evaluation of the properties of a LISA statistic is carried out for the local Moran, which is applied in a study of the spatial pattern of conflict for African countries and in a number of Monte Carlo simulations.},

The dynamic urban retail model (Harris and Wilson, Environ Plan A 10:371–388, 1978) is one of the most well known applications of this technique and is an example of a BLV (Boltzmann-Lotka-Volterra) model. We define an agent-based model (ABM) of urban retail and explore whether it can be made equivalent to a BLV model. Application of both models to the metropolitan county of South Yorkshire in the UK indicates that both models produce similar outputs. This direct comparison provides some insights into the differences and similarities of each approach, as well as highlighting the relative strengths and weaknesses. The ABM has the potential to be easier to disaggregate, while the entropy maximising model is more computationally efficient.},

	abstract = {Absolute physical distances are notoriously bad measures of the relative functional distances that influence the destination choices of U.S. interstate migrants. A novel calibration procedure for doubly constrained gravity models is proposed to map functional relative interstate separations. Doubly constrained models exactly reproduce observed migrant supplies and migrant demands. Using straight-line distances, however, they poorly reproduce the observed state-to-state patterns of flow. The proposed alternative calibration procedure leaves interstate separations as model outputs rather than model inputs. Distances are chosen to replicate observed flows. These distances define a "migration space" surrounding origin and destination states.},

Based on interviews with 432 migrants to Cape Cod, Massachusetts, this research indicates that migration does not preclude an emergent sense of home but that migration at different stages of the life cycle does produce different patterns of place affiliation. Where younger migrants more often base their identity on affiliations of friendship, family, and emotional self-attributions, older migrants do so in terms of dwelling and prior experience with place. Thus, this study challenges the view that place identity is eroded by mobility, arguing instead that place identification must be understood within the process of life cycle change and place mobility.},

	abstract = {Global matrices of bilateral migrant stocks spanning 1960–2000 are presented, disaggregated by gender and based primarily on the foreign-born definition of migrants. More than one thousand census and population register records are combined to construct decennial matrices corresponding to the five census rounds between 1960 and 2000. For the first time, a comprehensive picture of bilateral global migration over the second half of the 20th century emerges. The data reveal that the global migrant stock increased from 92 million in 1960 to 165 million in 2000. Quantitatively, migration between developing countries dominates, constituting half of all international migration in 2000. When the partition of India and the dissolution of the Soviet Union are accounted for, migration between developing countries is remarkably stable over the period. Migration from developing to developed countries is the fastest growing component of international migration in both absolute and relative terms. The United States has remained the most important migrant destination in the world, home to one fifth of the world's migrants and the top destination for migrants from some 60 sending countries. Migration to Western Europe has come largely from elsewhere in Europe. The oil-rich Persian Gulf countries emerge as important destinations for migrants from the Middle East and North Africa and South and Southeast Asia. Finally, although the global migrant stock is predominantly male, the proportion of female migrants increased noticeably between 1960 and 2000. The number of women rose in every region except South Asia.},

	abstract = {The performance and composition of the U.S. brewing industry have changed dramatically over the past three decades. More specifically, the industry has experienced contradictory shifts in both aggregate production volume and number of firms. While aggregate beer production in the US has increased modestly, per capita beer production has decreased steadily since the early 1980s, dropping 26 \% from a record 26.2 barrels per person in 1981 to a low of 19.5 barrels per person in 2011. However, the number of brewing establishments increased substantially during the same period, expanding from 48 breweries in 1981 to nearly 1,700 by 2011–a 3,500 \% increase. So what explains this counterintuitive story? And how has this story manifested itself over space? This chapter seeks to answer these questions by analyzing the economic geography of the U.S. craft brewing industry. Specifically, our empirical approach consists of three exercises. First, we examine the temporal changes in the aggregate production volume and the total number of brewing establishments for each state. Second, we examine state-level variation in total beer production, total craft-beer production, percent craft beer production, and per-capita craft beer production. And last, we map the precise location of craft beer establishments to show the spatial and temporal distribution of active craft breweries in the US. Our results are three-fold. First, we find the change in total brewing establishments and total beer production has manifested itself rather unevenly over space. Second, we find that craft-beer production at the state level has also increased in a spatially uneven manner, as the largest production still occurs in the states with a history of high beer production. Last, and in contrast to our first two exercises, we find that within states, the location of active craft-brewing establishments have spread from major urban centers in the 1980s to many non-urban locations by 2011. We conclude that although growth in the craft-brewing sector will continue to be highest in areas with already high levels of brewing activity, there will be significant growth in regions that currently have few brewing establishments.},

	abstract = {A relationship between people’s mobility and their social networks is presented based on an analysis of calling and mobility traces for one year of anonymized call detail records of over one million mobile phone users in Portugal. We find that about 80\% of places visited are within just 20   km of their nearest (geographical) social ties’ locations. This figure rises to 90\% at a ‘geo-social radius’ of 45   km. In terms of their travel scope, people are geographically closer to their weak ties than strong ties. Specifically, they are 15\% more likely to be at some distance away from their weak ties than strong ties. The likelihood of being at some distance from social ties increases with the population density, and the rates of increase are higher for shorter geo-social radii. In addition, we find that area population density is indicative of geo-social radius where denser areas imply shorter radii. For example, in urban areas such as Lisbon and Porto, the geo-social radius is approximately 7   km and this increases to approximately 15   km for less densely populated areas such as Parades and Santa Maria da Feira.},

	abstract = {Models of migration between regions are often based on the assumption that individual moves can be modelled by a Poisson distribution whose parameter is a function of origin and destination characteristics, and generalized cost; this is true of Poisson regression models and spatial interaction models. The Poisson assumption is that each individual acts independently from others making the same move. In fact, migration is usually engaged in by household groups, not independent individuals, making the Poisson assumption invalid. It is possible instead to construct a model in which the probability of a household moving is given by a Poisson model and the number of individuals in a moving household is given by an observed household-size distribution. This generalized Poisson model is explained and fitted to a set of data on local-level migration within the English county of Hereford and Worcester. However, the sparse nature of the data set raises problems in assessing goodness of fit because the deviance value is unusually low. This is tackled here with a simulation methodology.},

For two study regions, the East of England and Yorkshire and the Humber, the differences in output and consequences of adopting different methods are illustrated.

This research uses ordinary least squares regression to compare the effects of demographic, economic, and amenity factors on county-level net migration rates for five age groups: the young (25-44), the middle-aged (45-54), the pre-elderly (55-64), the young-old (65-74), and the old-old (75+). Pre-elderly migration patterns emerge as distinct from those of both younger and older age groups. Their net migration patterns are not fully shaped by labour force considerations. At the same time, pre-elderly migration appears to be driven by factors beyond retirement. These findings are discussed in the context of life-course change and their implications for the ageing baby-boom cohorts [considered]." excerpt},

	abstract = {This paper reports the results of an extensive project to model interregional migration within England and Wales. The project took place over a two-year period and was sponsored by the UK Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (formerly the Department of Transport, Local Government and the Regions). The results of the study are reported in three separate papers. In this paper we present an overview of the project and then describe in detail both the process of modelling out-migration rates from origins across England and Wales and the calibration results from this modelling stage. The results yield important information on the determinants of out-migration and population re-distribution within England and Wales. In paper 2 we describe the modelling of the destination choices of migrants and the calibration results from such models. In paper 3 we tie both the out-migration and the destination choice results together into a mapping and visualisation system (MIGMOD) which can be used to assess the impacts of various policies on population movements in England and Wales. The simple policy scenarios reported in this third paper are illustrative and indicative of the model's potential, rather than necessarily being a true reflection of the effects of policy changes. The three papers contribute substantially to the existing migration literature because they present the most exhaustive analysis of the determinants of both out-migration and destination choice that has ever been undertaken. The number of variables in both modelling processes is far larger than has ever been assembled before and the results therefore provide much greater insight into the role of various attributes in determining out-migration rates and in-migration rates than has previously been possible. The papers also provide an interesting lesson in a problem rarely encountered-that of having too much data.},
